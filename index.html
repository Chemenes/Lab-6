  <h1>Pat's Famous Salmon Cookies</h1>
  <p>We know what you're thinking,salmon and cookies shouldn't be in the same sentence. <br>
  How could you take two things that are so good on their own but together might smell a little something like cat litter.<br>
 Well we dared to go where no one would ever and actually created something incredibly delicious. <br>
 Pat, our infamous leader got the idea from a dare one late night cooking with friends. <br>
 A few hours later everyone in the room gladly accepted losing that dare. <br>
 Here at Pat's we want to bring worlds together that may not ever meet and create great memories through cookies. <br>
  We promise when you tell your cousin in Florida that you had the best salmon cookie you ever had it won't be a lie!</p>
